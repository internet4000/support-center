# Support Center

This project aims to offer an easy to maintain, minimalistic, unified, project-independant place for Internet4000's support pages.

## Hosting and deployment

This project is hosted on Netlify, and will be deployed to [support.internet4000.com](https://support.internet4000.com) for each new commit on the master branch of this git repository.
