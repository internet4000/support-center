# Support center

This project aims to offer an easy to maintain, minimalistic, unified, project-independant place for Internet4000's support pages.


## How to create a new "support project"

- duplicate an exisiting project's directory (ex: radio4000 and its content)
- reference a link to this new project's `index.html` in the root [index.html](https://github.com/internet4000/support-center/blob/master/index.html) document

A project is composed from at least an `index.html` file. It could also have assets as images, which should be stored in the project's folder.


## Hosting and deployment

This project is hosted on Netlify, and will be deployed to [support.internet4000.com](https://support.internet4000.com) for each new commit on the master branch of this git repository.
