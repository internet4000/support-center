Join the community's chat to hang out, find help or contribute to the
projects:

- [chat.radio4000.com](http://chat.radio4000.com) (goes to a riot page with `#radio4000:matrix.org`), and is an easy URL to remember. Talks and support about Radio4000.
- [#i4k-doctor:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#i4k-doctor:matrix.org), general channel, assistance and discussions of any type.

Connect to both chats with the free software for communication `Riot`, no registration needed (just follow the links above).

Technically, the chat uses the software [Riot](https://riot.im) to work with the
[Matrix](https://matrix.org) server networks. You are free to use [any
client compatibable with
Matrix](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) to
connect to the `#radio4000:matrix.org` and `#i4k-doctor:matrix.org` room.

Alternatively, there is a bridge syncrhonising messages from/to the
[freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC network. The room/channel is also
called `#radio4000`.
