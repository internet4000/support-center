			<h2>How do I create more than one radio?</h2>
			<p>You do not! You have <strong>one single radio</strong> that presentes your taste in music. This is one pillar of Radio4000:
				one radio = one human. While playlists are useful they can become painful to maintain. But if you only use one, you never
				have to consider where the song fits. Only whether you really enjoy that tune. According to us this leads to more exciting
				radios, creating unexpected bridges between genres, crossing through time, cultures and people. We explore this concept
				further in the <a href="https://radio4000.com/about">introduction</a>.</p>

			<h2>How do I add tracks from Bandcamp, Soundcloud etc.?</h2>
			<p>For now, we want to focus on creating the best possible experience on top of YouTube. We're considering more sources.</p>

		<article>
			<h2>Why can't I browse artists instead of radios?</h2>
			<p>The point of Radio4000 is to listen and discover music through the selection of another person. We don't want to offer a catalog similar to Spotify, iTunes or Google Music.</p>

			<h2>Why doesn't it stop playing on iPhone/iPad?</h2>
			<p>Unfortunately Apple decided to disallow autoplaying of videos on iOS. This means each time you want to watch a YouTube
				video it switches to the default YouTube app on your device. When the video has finished, we have no way to continue
				with the next song in the radio for you. While we work around it, we suggest you buy an Android device. Sorry…</p>

			<h2>Are you planning on having native mobile apps, Android, iOS, Blackberry?</h2>
			<p>No, not really. Radio4000 is build with web techonologies, which means there is as long as you have a modern browser, it will work by visiting the website. We do not support the idea of exclusive native applications. If you're reading this, you're already here. We want to make a single application that works anywhere. Here is our <a href="https://radio4000.com/about/technology">technologys stack</a>, if it is of your interest. Feel free to contact us if you would like to talk!</p>

			<h2>What data do you need from my Facebook or Google account?</h2>
			<p>None, really. We don't want your name, your pictures, your sex, age, or any other attribute. The only reason you have to register is so that we can associate your radio with you, and be sure only you access it. You can always sign up with e-mail instead.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h2>Is Radio4000 anonymous?</h2>
			<p>Short answer is yes. Long answer is no. Why? Everyone see radios the same way. Everything you add to your channel is public. But if you don't want anyone to know who's behind, don't write your own name; except if you actually want them to know. It is up to you. About the long answer, unfortunately, is there such thing as anonymity on the internet? Not as it is right now. So to us, we want to do as much as possible to keep you pricacy intact. We recommend you to <a href="https://ssd.eff.org">read this</a>, if you have any concerns.</p>

			<h2>Why can't I sort the tracks in my radio?</h2>
			<p>This is the first question we asked ourselves. As you're beginning to add tracks to your first radio, you would like to spend time sorting them, making sure each one fits perfectly in order; or maybe interpose a group of tracks from the same artist you added in a row? Please, don't worry about that. It is a radio. It's supposed to be worry-free. As long as you enjoy what's in your radio, it's all good. Remember you can play radios in shuffle mode (click the shuffle icon on the player during a listening session).</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h2>Any plans for a pro version?</h2>
			<p>Yes. We are discussing and experimenting with the right business model. We want it to retribute artists and right holders whose tracks are on Radio4000 as people contributing to make Radio4000 a great music tool and radio service. We also want the price to be worth it, so you know precisely what and why why you contribute.</p>
