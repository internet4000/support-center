				<h2>How do you mix radio channels?</h2>
				<p>The general idea is to make a transition between a first track and a second, so the music keeps playing without interuption. The style of it is all yours.</p>
				<p>What you can do to get started is to play a track on Deck A, put the volume of it at its maximum (100%) while the volume of Deck B is at its minimum. Then, start playing the track on Deck B (which you won't hear since the volume is off), and slowly start to transition the volume level from Deck A to Deck B, using the crossfader.</p>

				<h2>What is a Deck?</h2>
				<p>
					A Deck is represented by the Radio4000 player that will play a radio channel. It is composed of a Radio channel, its image and name, the video of the current track playing, the list of tracks composing this channel, annd control buttons (play/pause, next track, mute, shuffle...).

				<h2>What is the crossfader?</h2>
				<p>
					The crossfader is the volume slider in between the two decks. When you slide it, it changes the volume of both decks; on one it increases the volume, on the other it decreases it. It can be used to apply a smooth volume transitions between two tracks, so they get "mixed" together.
